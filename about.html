        Emucore is a repository from Open Source projects or emulators aviable for everyone.
        We ensure quality of the projects and suport from development to improve emulators or rescue old projects from
        research
        propourses.
        We don't endorse piracy, we believe that emulators are forms of perservations to old consoles that are not
        aviable to the
        public anymore. Our mision is provide emulators to the public for backup process or homebrew development of
        games to old
        consoles.
        Emucore rescues abandonwares from old emulators to compare on new ones.
